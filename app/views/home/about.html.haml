          About
        %p
          Passive capture is a project created by 
          = link_to "Stuart Illson", "http://www.stuartillson.com", :target => "_blank"
          to enable greater insight & visualization into anadromous fish runs in the Pacific Northwest.
        %p 
          Soon we will launch a dashboard and statistics for each of the dams marked on a map. Farther down the line we will analyze data spanning the past several decades to allow us to project fish counts, large-scale fish kills, and the rate at which our native fish move through the Columbia River watershed.
